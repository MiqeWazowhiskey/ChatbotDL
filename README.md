## Overview
AI chatbot built using PyTorch and NLTK, designed to classify user input into predefined intents using a feed-forward neural network. It uses basic natural language processing (tokenization, lemmatization, bag-of-words) to convert text into numerical vectors, which are then fed into a trained model to generate context-aware responses.
( Built simple WebAPI and client to test and fun ) 
### Requirements
 * Python 3.8+
 * NumPy
 * Pytorch
 * NLTK
